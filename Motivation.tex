\section{Motivation}


The reconstruction algorithm for charged particles has imperfections that result in uncertainties of reconstructed momentum values.
The necessity of particle momentum corrections is particularly evident from the exclusive channel analyses.
These channels provide analyzers easy access to the invariant quantities that can be calculated for each event and compared to the known constants.
The distributions of these invariant values exhibit significant shifts from their expected positions in multiple analysis channels, such as exclusive $ep\rightarrow e\pi^+(N)$, $ep\rightarrow e\pi^+\pi^-P$, $ep\rightarrow e\pi^+P$ etc.
Often, an attentive look at these variables is necessary to spot the problem due to the kinematic dependencies of the reconstruction inaccuracies.
Sometimes the most common plot of 1D distribution does not show the strong deviation from the nominal value because the shift depends on, e.g., momentum of the particle, and when integrated, the mean value is positioned as expected.
In reality, however, the distribution can be shifted strongly for low momentum particles which would not be visible on an integrated plot.
